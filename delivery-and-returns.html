              <h1>Delivery & Returns</h1>
              <h2>Shipping/Delivery</h2>
              <p>Our standard spirit delivery is 1-2 working days and is complimentary over a £50 spend.</p>

              <p>At the moment, we don’t offer same day delivery or special delivery. Please note that our delivery dates may be affected by public holidays and some
                geographic locations. Orders placed Monday – Friday (excluding bank holidays) before 11am GMT will be dispatched on the same day.</p>

              <p>Still Shed Distillery insures each purchase during the time it is in transit until it is delivered to you. We require a signature for any goods
                delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a recipient who is not you for delivery
                purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery address) is evidence of delivery
                and fulfilment by Still Shed Distillery and transfer of responsibility in the same way.</p>

              <p>If possible, please check the condition of your parcel before you sign for it. If it’s at all damaged, don’t sign for it but hand it back to the courier
                to return to us. If you only discover that your parcel is damaged after you’ve signed for it, please call 07469 931 116 or
                email distillery@stillshed.co.uk</p>

              <p>To purchase products from Still Shed Distillery, you must be of legal age to buy alcohol in the country in which you reside.
                Delivery will only be made to individuals of legal purchase age and our delivery company will require a signature on delivery. Our delivery
                company will check ID if they are unsure of the recipient’s age.</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, we do not deliver to addresses outside the UK. You may place an order for product(s) from outside the UK if you have a UK
                billing address for your credit or debit card, but the order must be for delivery to an address within the UK.</p>

              <p>Please be advised that whilst we ship to most locations within the UK we do not offer this service for Northern Ireland, Jersey, Guernsey,
                The Orkney Islands, The Isle of Scilly, Ireland, The Highlands, The Isle of Wight and The Isle of Man.
                Please contact us directly on 07469 931 116 for advice on delivery to these locations.</p>

              <h2>Returns</h2>
              <p>Unfortunately, as perishable goods and some flammable liquids, we regret that we do not offer returns on our products, unless due to defect or fault.</p>

              <p>If faulty, please contact us on 07469 931 116 or email distillery@stillshed.co.uk detailing the nature of your fault. If you have returned the product(s)
                to us because they are faulty or misdescribed, once we have investigated and approved the matter, we will endeavour to replace/exchange the faulty goods
                as soon as possible or refund the price of a defective product in full and any applicable delivery charges.</p>
