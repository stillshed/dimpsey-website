                <ol>
                  <li>In this Section 3 we have set out:
                    <ul>
                      <li>the general categories of personal data that we may process;</li>

                      <li>the purposes for which we may process personal data; and</li>
                      <li>the legal bases of the processing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />

                      <p>We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:</p>
                      <li>where we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests); and</li>
                      <li>where it is needed in the public interest.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <br/>
                  <p>There are more limited circumstances where we process personal data pursuant to your consent.</p>

                  <li>Please do not supply any other person’s personal data to us, unless we prompt you to do so.</li>
                  <p>Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which justify our use of your personal information.</p>

                  <p>We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

                  <p>Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

                  <p><b>Automated decision making</b></p>

                  <p>You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on automated decision-making unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.</p>

                  <p><b>SPECIAL CATEGORY PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></p>

                  <p>You may also provide or we may collect, store and use the following “special categories” of more sensitive personal information regarding you where there is relevant in relation to your instructions:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>information about your race or ethnicity, religious beliefs, sexual orientation and political opinions;</li>
                    <li>information about your criminal convictions and offences; and</li>
                    <li>information about your health, including any medical condition;</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br />

                  <p>“Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require differing levels of protection. We need to have different justifications for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>with your explicit written consent;</li>
                    <li>where it is needed to establish, bring or defend legal claims;</li>
                    <li>where we need to carry out our legal obligations relating to employment law, social security law or social protection law; and</li>
                    <li>where it is needed to assess your working capacity on health grounds, subject to appropriate confidentiality safeguards.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br />

                  <p>Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed to protect your vital interests (or someone else’s vital interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.</p>

                  <p>Whilst we are unlikely to process any of the personal information described above, if we do request any of the above special categories of personal information from you, you are not required to provide such information, but if you do not do so, we may not be able to properly provide our services to clients.</p>

                </ol>
                
              </li>

Still Shed Distillery Limited will act as a data controller in relation to the enquiry data that we supply to it; and upon contacting you, Still Shed Distillery Limited will supply to you a copy of its own privacy policy, which will govern that third party’s use of your personal data.</li>
                  <li>In addition to the specific disclosures of personal data set out in this Section 4, we may disclose your personal data where such disclosure is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of another natural person.

                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <br />

                  <p><b>DATA SECURITY</b></p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</li>
                    <li>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.</li>
                    <li>You should take all reasonable steps to keep your personal information held on out IT systems secure, including choosing a secure password if you have an online account with us and not disclosing your passwords to anybody else.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Retaining and deleting personal data
                <ol>
                  <li>The duration for which we retain your personal information will differ depending on the type of information and the reason why we collected it from you. However, in some cases personal information may be retained on a long term basis: for example, personal information that we need to retain for legal purposes will normally be retained in accordance with usual commercial practice and regulatory requirements. Generally, where there is no legal requirement we retain all physical and electronic records for period of [6] years after your last contact with us. Exceptions to this rule are:
                    <ol>
                      <li>Information that may be relevant to any discrimination claims may be retained until the limitation period for those types of claims has expired.</li>
                    </ol>
                  </li>
                  <br />
                  <p>It is important to ensure that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and up-to-date, and you should let us know if anything changes, for example if your contact details. You will be able to update some of the personal information we hold about you through any account you hold with us.</p>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Amendments to this policy
                <ol>
                  <li>We may update this policy from time to time by publishing a new version on our website.</li>
                  <li>You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are happy with any changes to this policy.</li>
                  <li>You can also obtain an up-to-date copy of our privacy notice by contacting us as described in paragraph •. Should you object to any alteration, please contact us.</li>
                </ol>
                <li>Your rights
                <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it;</li>
                  <li>request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected;</li>
                  <li>request the erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to stop processing personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground;</li>
                  <li>request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it;</li>
                  <li>object to the processing of your personal information based on legitimate interests, but not if we have a compelling reason to process it;</li>
                  <li>object to automated decision making (although this does not currently apply as we do not currently carry out automated decision making); and</li>
                  <li>request the transfer of your personal information to another party.</li>

                  <br />

                  <p>Where you have given us your consent to use your personal information in a particular manner i.e. where you have given us consent to receive information about products and services you may be interested in, you have the right to withdraw this consent at any time, which you may do by contacting us as described in paragraph 12. Please note however that the withdrawal of your consent will not affect any use of the data made before you withdrew your consent and we may still be entitled to hold and process the relevant personal information to the extent that we are entitled to do so on bases other than your consent.</p>

                  <p>If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please use the contact details in paragraph 12.</p>

                  <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>

                  <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.</p>
                </ol>

                <ol>
                  <li>A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.</li>
                  <li>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.</li>
                  <li>Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.</li>
