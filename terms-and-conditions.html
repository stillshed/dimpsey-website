                BUT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS WHEN YOU SHOP WITH US.</p>

              <p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the Dimpsey Gin online shop.</p>

              <p>We must receive payment of the whole of the price for the goods that you order before your order can be accepted.
                Once payment has been received, we will confirm that your order has been accepted by sending an email to you at the email address you have provided
                to us when making an order. Our acceptance of your order brings into existence a legally binding contract between us.</p>

              <h2 class="featurette-heading">Age of Consent</h2>

              <p>Our standard spirit delivery is 2-4 working days. Orders are currently despatched between Thursday and Saturday. As we use a third party courier, on occasion we do experience some breakages which may delay your order.</p>

              <p>We require a signature for any goods delivered, at which point responsibility for your purchased goods passes to you. If you have specified a
                recipient who is not you for delivery purposes (for example as a gift) then you accept that evidence of a signature by them (or at that delivery
                address) is evidence of delivery and fulfilment by Still Shed Distillery and transfer of responsibility in the same way.</p>

                <p>If possible, please check the condition of your parcel before you sign for it. If it’s at all damaged, don’t sign for it but hand it back to the
                  courier to return to us. If you only discover that your parcel is damaged after you’ve signed for it, please call 07469 931 116 or email
                  distillery@stillshed.co.uk.</p>
